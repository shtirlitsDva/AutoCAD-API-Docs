# Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices.LineWeight Enumeration

## Overview

#### Description
This .NET class wraps the AcDb::LineWeight ObjectARX enumerated type. 
This enumerated type provides the line weight (thickness) values used to specify how lines will be displayed and plotted. The lineweights are in 100ths of a millimeter, except for the negative values. The negative values denote the default indicated by their constant's name.
